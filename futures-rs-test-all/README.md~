# futures-rs

This is an **experimental** work in progress library for an implementation of
futures in Rust.

## Usage

First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
futures = { git = "https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs" }
```

Next, add this to your crate:

```rust
extern crate futures;

use futures::Future;
```

And then, use futures!

## Current status

This library is currently a work in progress, but it is rapidly progressing to
the point of stabilization of the internal `Future` and `Stream` traits along
with a number of sourrounding pieces for useful functionality. Some crates are
available on crates.io but are likely not functional, so the git repo should be
used for now, but that will hopefully change soon!

We're currently targeting a broader announcement and call to action (including
improved docs, entry points for beginngers, places to contribute, etc) in early
September, so stay tuned!

## Why Futures?

A major missing piece of the Rust ecosystem has been how to work with
Asynchronous I/O and in general composing many I/O tasks together in a
lightweight way across libraries. Futures have worked out fantastically in other
languages to solve this problem in frameworks like [finagle] and [wangle], and
they also turn out to be a great way to solve this problem in Rust as well!

The purpose of the `futures` library in this repository is to provide the
foundational layer to build an ecosystem of futures-generating computations so
they can all compose with one another.

## The `Future` trait

At the heart of this crate is [the `Future` trait][Future], which in true Rust
style, is an interface for **zero allocation futures**. Like iterators in Rust
the are a wide variety of helpful combinators associated with this trait which
are also zero allocation and serve as a succinct and powerful way to compose
computations on futures.

The `Future` trait is driven by two methods, [`poll`][poll] and
[`schedule`][schedule], which all pulling values out of a future and otherwise
getting notified when a future is complete. More documentation can be found on
the associated methods themselves.

## I/O with futures

With the power of zero-allocation futures we can take futures all the way down
the stack to the I/O layer. The [`futures-io` crate][futures-io] provides an
abstraction for I/O objects as a stream of readiness notifications plus `Read`
and `Write` traits along with a number of combinators you'd expect when working
with `std::io`.

These abstractions can be implemented by the [`futures-mio` crate][futures-mio]
to use [`mio`][mio] to power I/O. Finally we can then use these abstractions to
build a [`futures-tls` crate][futures-tls] crate to provide TLS/SSL streams over
arbitrary read/write streams.
